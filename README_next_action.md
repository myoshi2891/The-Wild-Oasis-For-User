# 0) One-time setup (local)

```bash
# clone & enter
git clone https://github.com/myoshi2891/MasterModernReact_NextJs
cd MasterModernReact_NextJs

# Node per repo constraint
# use corepack/pnpm or nvm; repo ships package-lock.json so npm is fine:
nvm use 20 || nvm install 20 && nvm use 20

npm ci   # (or: npm i)
```

Install Codex CLI (pick one):

```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex        # or: bun i -g @openai/codex
# macOS/Linux:
# brew install codex
```

Auth (choose one):

```bash
codex                     # TUI sign-in (ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Team/Edu/Enterprise)
# or
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."   # if you prefer API key
```

> Security note: avoid exporting secrets directly in the shell (they can land in history/logs). Prefer a `.env` file or a secrets manager, never commit `.env`, and clear shell history if you previously exported a key.
> Why this matters here: your repo supports Node 20+ and CI checks 20/22 alongside testing libs we’ll target (Vitest, Playwright). ([GitHub][1])

# 1) Quick wins: explain, map, and set guardrails

From the repo root:

```bash
# 1) Summarize the codebase & surface hotspots first
codex "Explain this Next.js 14 app (App Router). Identify risk hotspots:
- NextAuth v4 config, CSRF/session handling
- Supabase client usage/RLS assumptions/server actions
- Data fetching performance (SSR/ISR/cache tags)
- Image optimization & next.config.mjs domains"

# 2) Create/verify project docs (keeps future reviews grounded)
codex "Generate or update ARCHITECTURE.md and RUNBOOK.md using repo context.
Include: auth flow, data access layer, cache/ISR strategy, e2e test entrypoints."
```

Codex reads the repo and produces docs/patches without you copy-pasting files. Keep **approvals: Read-only** first; flip to **Auto** when you’re ready to let it write changes.

---

# 2) Code review you’ll actually merge

## A) Local, targeted review

```bash
# PR/branch review with concrete policy
codex "/review app/**/*.js app/**/*.tsx:
- Enforce our standards from .eslintrc.json
- Flag N+1 queries or redundant Supabase roundtrips
- Validate NextAuth v4 config & middleware auth guards
- Propose minimal diffs as patch hunks"
```

Tips that work well in this repo:

- Ask explicitly for **Server Actions** guardrails (form validation, idempotency).
- Require **explained** diffs (“why is this safe?”) before accepting patch.

## B) CI auto-review (keeps humans in control)

- Add a CI job that runs `codex exec "review and propose minimal diffs"`.
- Gate on **human approval** (branch protection stays on).
- Have Codex comment on PRs with rationale and link to tests it adds.
  (“Autofix CI / review with approvals” is a standard Codex pattern.) ([GitHub][1])

---

# 3) Tests: grow coverage where it matters

Your repo already lists **Vitest**, **@testing-library/react**, and **Playwright**. ([GitHub][1])

### A) Unit & component tests (Vitest/@testing-library)

```bash
codex "Create Vitest tests for app/_lib/data-service.js:
- Cover getCabins, getBookedDatesByCabinId
- Mock Supabase client; assert error paths & empty states
- Property-based test for date range → booked days"
```

### B) Auth & middleware tests

```bash
codex "Add tests for middleware.js:
- Authenticated vs unauthenticated routing
- Session expiry, invalid token, and locale handling
- Minimal fixtures, no network"
```

### C) E2E (Playwright) smoke paths

```bash
codex "Create Playwright specs for cabins > booking > account:
- Seed data via Supabase admin client mock or test DB URL
- Login via NextAuth (test provider) with CSRF checks
- Golden-snapshot key pages, stable selectors"
```

### D) CI policy

- Fail PR if **new code lacks tests** touching SSR/server-actions.
- Quarantine **flaky** tests; ask Codex to rewrite with stable waits.

---

# 4) Security & data correctness passes (high ROI)

```bash
codex "Audit NextAuth v4 config:
- Session strategy, CSRF, callback URLs, trustHost, cookies, secure flag
- Add regression tests for auth routes and middleware"
```

```bash
codex "Audit Supabase usage for RLS assumptions:
- Ensure all reads/writes align with policies
- Replace admin client in UI paths with user client
- Add tests proving unauthorized access is blocked"
```

```bash
codex "Scrub PII logging; ensure no email/token in server logs.
Add a tiny redact util and use it in server actions."
```

(These align with the stack declared in your README and folder structure.) ([GitHub][1])

---

# 5) Performance & UX quick checks

```bash
codex "Profile data fetching:
- Convert obvious SSR to ISR + cache tagging where safe
- Add revalidate tags; show before/after TTFB estimates
- Batch Supabase requests; prefer single select with relations where possible"
```

```bash
codex "Audit next/image usage & next.config.mjs: verify allowed remote domains,
disable unneeded formats, and add priority hints for LCP elements."
```

```bash
codex "Identify any unbounded Promise.all; introduce p-limit with sensible concurrency,
add timeouts & abort signals for remote calls."
```

(Repo advertises ISR/App Router; use that to trim TTFB.) ([GitHub][1])

---

# 6) Agents-style workflows (safe, incremental)

Keep it simple: one repo-scoped “builder” and one “reviewer.”

```bash
# One-shot, non-interactive (good for CI): fix & PR
codex exec "Fix failing tests and open a PR 'test: stabilize and expand coverage'"
```

If/when you want more, move to the **Agents SDK** + **MCP** (Git/FS tools only), then compose:

- **Planner** → task breakdown
- **Implementer** → code + tests
- **Reviewer** → policy/security pass
  (Still require human approval for merges.)

---

# 7) Concurrency (without foot-guns)

- Shard by area and run multiple Codex jobs:

  ```bash
  codex exec "refactor app/cabins/* for accessibility" &
  codex exec "harden auth middleware; add tests" &
  wait
  ```

- Lock shared files (`package.json`, migrations).
- Keep **approvals=Read-only** until a branch is isolated; then enable **Auto**.

---

# 8) Ready-to-paste prompt pack (tuned to your repo)

```text
[Review: security/perf]
Review this diff for The Wild Oasis (Next 14, NextAuth v4, Supabase):
- Flag auth/session/CSRF issues; propose minimal fixes
- Eliminate N+1 or redundant fetches; show single-query alternatives
- Explain each fix, add tests that fail-before / pass-after

[Tests: server actions]
Generate Vitest tests for app/_lib/actions.js:
- Validate inputs, optimistic UI, idempotency
- Mock Supabase; include error branches and race conditions

[Perf: cache/ISR]
Convert eligible SSR paths to ISR with cache tags; document revalidation policy;
prove TTFB reduction with a quick measurement plan.
```

## Want me to **run** Codex review/tests on this repo and open a PR with suggested changes?

I can do it, but I’ll keep merges human-approved and limit scope to your repo (no external network without asking). If you’d like that, say the word and I’ll proceed from your GitHub link.

**Sources:** I based this plan on your public repo structure and tech stack (Next 14, Node engines, testing libs) and project overview. ([GitHub][1])
